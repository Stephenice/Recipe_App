- HTML5 & CSS3

The layout was carefully designed using CSS3 BEM naming convention. CSS-Grid was used to comply with the newest standards of development.

No frameworks were used in the development of this application. All functionality was built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript so feel free to dive into the code.
